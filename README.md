Project for Launchcode's Liftoff Project


hello friends, this is Anna! Doing this again, b/c it's not registering me as a contributor >:(

Hello! This is Ashley!

Hello this is Goldi

When setting the project up to run locally, copy the file main/resources/application-default.properties.example and paste it into the same folder.
Change the name of the new file to application-default.properties.
Change the values for my-username and my-password to the correct values.
This file has been added to the .gitignore file and should not be committed to the repo to maintain security of username and password.
